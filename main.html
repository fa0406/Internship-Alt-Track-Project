        <p><strong> We releases LOVE YOURSELF : 'HER'! </strong></p>
        <p> “Loving yourself is the beginning of true love”, all the different faces of love expressed through the signature music of BTS! On September 18, we will release 承 'HER', the first album in the new LOVE YOURSELF series. LOVE YOURSELF 承 'HER' is an expression of the anxiety and elation of love, told in the unique style of BTS.

        <p>First unveiled in March of 2016, the BTS LOVE YOURSELF series creates a narrative by linking the key songs in each album into a single theme, imparting the message that “loving yourself is true love”. Like a well-written novel having introduction, development, twists, and conclusion it shared a compelling story for two and a half years.

        <h2>4TH FULL-LENGTH ALBUM</h2>
        <p><strong>We releases 4th Studio Album “MAP OF THE SOUL : 7”</strong></p>
        <p>It's the most favourite album. BTS will release their fourth studio album “MAP OF THE SOUL : 7” on February 21. Unveiled last year, the MAP OF THE SOUL series contains the honest and heartfelt story of BTS and their journey of discovering their true selves. The first chapter of this story, “MAP OF THE SOUL : PERSONA”, sang about the world and the joy of love, and the discovery of the self as it is displayed to the world; “MAP OF THE SOUL : 7” now turns inward to the shadow.</p>

        <p><strong>“Dynamite” is a Disco Pop single that sings of joy and confidence</strong></p>

It also marks BTS’ first song to be released completely in English; having sought a “breakthrough” to overcome a sense of disheartenment from within the new global climate, BTS embarks on a new challenge through “Dynamite.”</p>

        <h2>NEW ALBUM</h2>
        <p><strong>We are returning with their new album BE to unfold another chapter of 2020.</strong></p>
        <p>As a sense of helplessness looms in every corner of the world, we open ourselves up to express their mixed feelings about this situation—fear and anxiety mingled with the determination to overcome all this. The album consists of a total of eight tracks including the No.1 summer hit “Dynamite” and lead single “Life Goes On”. The latter speaks on behalf of everyone stuck in the new normality brought on by COVID-19.</p>
